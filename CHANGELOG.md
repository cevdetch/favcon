## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Select SVG precision against the source's static 512px appearance with a 1% error budget.
  Keep compact precision 1 for passing marks; retry higher precision and retain unrounded
  source geometry if no candidate passes. Preserve animation/style/accessibility and use
  the same selector in browser and CLI. Reuse accepted pixels in the bounded placement cache.
  Correct gradient-stop rounding and small-viewBox geometry, and bump to 0.3.0 for cache identity.
  Refresh the Vite PWA comparison for corrected inputs; the old 2.9%-smaller claim no longer applies.

- Add PNG/ICO quality 1–100 across CLI, config/API, integrations and browser. Default 80
  balances size and fidelity; explicit 100 uses the higher-fidelity fixed-palette path. Custom colors without quality
  retain the fixed-palette path; explicit quality below 100 cannot combine with colors.
  Keep Zopfli independent and opt-in.

- Skip Zopfli by default; opt in with `--zopfli`, `zopfli: true`, or the browser's extra
  compression control. Release/fast effort remains 120/15 when enabled.
- Emit one optimized `icon.svg` preserving animation, styling and accessibility for both
  favicon and page use. Keep `--no-animation` as an explicit static option; retire `logo.svg`.
- Run complete alignment searches and raster outputs in bounded batches, with a canvas
  budget, serial fallback for large custom sizes, drained failures and owned native bytes.

- Try lossless Sub filtering before final compression for bare PNGs with full palettes,
  retaining the smaller preliminary encode. Both hosts share the change; 120/15 iterations
  remain unchanged. Bump to 0.2.0 so integration caches cannot reuse previous output bytes.
- Reduce browser image-engine initial shared memory from 250 to 64 MiB and cap spare worker
  preload at four, preserving memory growth, fallback spawning and cleanup.
- Rebuild the same Zopfli source with LLVM23 for the browser and CLI, retaining 120/15
  compression iterations and exact output bytes. Include the binary hash in engine/cache
  identity, ship licenses, and add reproducible build and performance scripts.
- Validate WASM requirements inside the image worker as well as the page, so missing worker
  isolation fails clearly even when a browser still exposes shared memory.
- Add CI browser parity and lifecycle checks for Firefox, WebKit and Chromium, with mobile
  Chrome/WebKit emulation and touch/download checks at 320 px.
- Correct browser instructions for selecting the CLI's fast mode through its config file.

- Browser and CLI now use the same pinned image engine, compression, shared options and build
  pipeline, with byte parity checked in Chromium. Browser builds run in a worker, support
  release/fast modes and cancellation, preserve previous downloads on failure, and cache one
  completed build. Placement renders are reused within a bounded per-build cache in both hosts.
- Browser hosting now supplies cross-origin isolation headers for shared WASM memory.
- Correct the ZIP writer's fixed DOS date to 1 January 1980.
- Keep generated download URLs alive when the browser preserves the page for Back/Forward
  navigation, and key cached manifests by the shared emitter's exact output.

- Rename the unpublished project to Favseed: package, CLI, configuration files,
  Astro/Vite imports and public API names. Existing local configurations must use
  `favseed.config.*`; no optimisation settings or icon formats change.

- Update repository and maintainer links to `cevdetch` and connect the package
  and website publisher to `https://cevdet.ch/`.

### Added

- Code of conduct, security policy, feature-request form and pull-request
  template. CODEOWNERS requests maintainer review; Dependabot checks pinned
  GitHub Actions weekly with a seven-day cooldown.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **A website**, <https://favseed.cevdet.ch> (`site/`): favseed in the browser, client-side,
  nothing uploaded. Astro, with a WASM raster stage (`@resvg/resvg-wasm`, `image-q`,
  `@jsquash/oxipng`) and a dependency-free zip writer. `logo.svg`, `icon.svg`,
  `site.webmanifest` and the safe-zone placement are byte-identical to the CLI's; the PNGs land
  within −6.1 % to +8.3 % of the CLI's at the defaults, and the page says so with the
  measurements rather than a disclaimer.
- **`lib/core.mjs`**, favseed's isomorphic half (the svgo stage, the ICO container, the mask
  maths, the manifest and the `<link>` block), imported by both the CLI and the website so the
  two cannot drift. Three seams make it portable: svgo is injected, the mask maths takes decoded
  pixels, and `icoWrap` works in `Uint8Array`. See decision 21.
- `site/test/cdp-check.mjs`: runs the real browser pipeline over four fixtures in headless
  Chromium, driven over the DevTools protocol with Node's built-in `WebSocket` and serving
  `dist/` from inside its own process. Checks PNG and ICO magic bytes, not byte counts alone.

- **One padded icon set, declared `"any maskable"`.** Every `--sizes` entry is placed in
  the W3C safe zone (a circle of radius 40 %) on `--bg`, the way the apple icon already was,
  so there is no separate `icon-maskable-512.png`: the set is both in truth, and Chrome will
  not install a PWA whose icons are all `maskable`. `--bg none` opts out in full:
  transparent, unpadded, `"any"` only. `icon.svg` is never listed in the manifest
  (crbug.com/40925759). On desktops, which do not mask, the icons show a smaller mark on
  their ground; that cost is stated rather than hidden (decision 22).
- The placement is measured by default and fixed on request: the farthest opaque pixel
  decides the scale at the icon's own size, and the scale then snaps down, within 10 %, to a
  size where the mark lands on whole pixels if that at least halves its anti-aliased pixels.
  That measurement is now the default of **`--padding`** (`auto`); a number overrides it with
  a fixed percentage per side, applied as given and never snapped. `build()` returns it as
  `fit: { apple, icons }`, and `placeInSafeZone()` is exported so the test suite's reference
  places the mark the same way.

- `favseed/astro`: an Astro integration. Builds in `astro:build:start` so Astro's ordinary
  `public/` copy carries the files to `outDir`: correct for static output and for every SSR
  adapter. Head tags via an `order: 'post'` middleware, a `<Head />` component, or logged for
  pasting.
- A content-addressed build cache for the integration, keyed on favseed's version, the input
  bytes, the canonicalised options **and** the versions of `@napi-rs/image` and `@gfx/zopfli`,
  so an engine upgrade invalidates it instead of serving stale bytes without notice.
- The integration refuses to overwrite a file in `public/` it did not write itself, checked by
  content rather than by filename. A file that already matches what it was about to write is
  left alone, so a clean install does not accuse you of hand-editing your own favicon.
- `build()`, `defineConfig()`, `optimiseSvg()`, `icoWrap()`, `engineVersions()` and
  `FavseedError` are exported, with types. `build()` throws; the CLI still exits.
- **A config file.** `favseed.config.js`, `.mjs` or `.ts` in the working directory sets any
  option, plus `input`, `base` and `mode`, which have no flag. Flags win; `--var` merges by
  name. `defineConfig` is exported from `favseed` with types. `base` reaches the `--html` links
  and the manifest's icon URLs, and the summary names the mode.
- **`favseed/vite`**, a Vite 8 plugin. Dev serves the set from memory in fast mode and rebuilds
  on change; a build emits the release set at the output root and links it in `index.html`;
  `virtual:favseed` exports the links and the files. It never shadows a different file in
  `public/`, shares the Astro integration's content-addressed cache, and leaves the manifest
  to vite-plugin-pwa when that is present, with `favseedIcons()` for its `manifest.icons`.
- `test/run.mjs`: the definition of done as `node:test`, with a PNG reader and an accuracy
  gate written over `node:zlib`. No bash, no ImageMagick.
- `bench/bench.mjs`: sweeps palette size, dither, stage order, zopfli iterations and the ICO
  container over `test/fixtures/`, and regenerates `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.
- Twelve neutral fixtures, authored here. `heavy.svg` is generated by a committed script and
  calibrated to fail at `floatPrecision: 0` and pass at `1`.
- CI on Node 24: the whole suite on `ubuntu-24.04` (pinned), `macos-15` and `windows-latest`,
  a job that fails if the three disagree on a single output byte, a site build with a
  headless-browser check, and a lint of the workflows themselves.

### Changed

- **One engine, nothing to install.** `@napi-rs/image` renders, quantises and recompresses,
  and `@gfx/zopfli` (WASM) finishes the winner, both pinned to exact versions, so
  `npx favseed` needs Node 24 and no binaries. Renders are pixel-identical to `resvg -w N -h N`.
  Against the native resvg, pngquant and oxipng pipeline the PNGs are 3.6 % smaller over the
  fixtures (79 614 B against 82 605 B): 9.0 % smaller on the gradient, 0.46 % larger on the
  nine flat marks. Decision 26. The rasters stay one job at a time: parallel workers saved 13.5 %, short of the
  20 % bar (decision 27).

- **Node 24 or newer** (`engines: >=24`): CI tests one version, and 24 is both the floor
  and the current LTS.

- **`--colors` defaults to 256** (was 8). 8 colours missed the 1.0 % accuracy bar on
  anti-aliased marks and put 27 % of a gradient's pixels off by a visible margin; at 256 every
  non-gradient fixture is at least 8.8× inside the bar, for 44.6 % more bytes. 256 is a ceiling,
  not a target: a flat mark still uses only the colours it has. `--colors 8` restores the old
  trade. Decision 24.

- **`apple-touch-icon.png` now places the mark inside the safe zone.** It stays 180 px. iOS
  cuts the icon to a rounded square; unplaced, a mark with a 6 % margin lost 12 corner pixels to
  it. This changes the bytes of every `apple-touch-icon.png`, and the accuracy gate's reference
  for it is the placed source.
- **`--sizes` now defaults to `192 512`, was `256 512`.** web.dev's install criteria, Chrome's
  docs and MDN all ask for a 192 and a 512 `any` icon. This renames an output file:
  `icon-256.png` becomes `icon-192.png`.
- **`--bg` now defaults to `#000000`, was `#ffffff`.** iOS composites a transparent Home
  Screen icon onto black, so black is what the platform would have produced anyway; the
  default now says so instead of substituting white. A mark drawn on a light ground wants
  `--bg '#fff'`, and the warning when the flag is absent has always been there to ask.
- `svgo` is imported rather than spawned, and the plugins are plain objects. Removes a temp
  config directory, ~110 lines of stringified plugin source, an env-var channel and two Node
  startups. Output is byte-identical.
- Errors are prefixed `favseed:` (was `favicon.mjs:`).

### Fixed

- **The Astro integration no longer adds a second set of icon links** to a page that already
  links one with a `rel` such as `alternate icon`. It checked for a `rel` that starts with
  `icon`; favseed now looks for the `icon` keyword in any `<link>`'s `rel`, in the Astro
  middleware and in `favseed/vite` alike.

- **`<desc>` no longer reaches `icon.svg` or `logo.svg`.** svgo's `removeDesc` keeps any
  description that is not empty or an editor stamp, unless told otherwise; `general.svg`'s
  87-byte description was 30 % of its 289-byte `icon.svg`. The rasters are byte-identical.

- **A translucent `--bg` is refused.** The probe only checked that resvg parses the colour,
  so `transparent`, `rgba(…, 0)` and 8-digit hex passed, and the padded icons shipped with
  alpha while the manifest declared them maskable. favseed now reads the probe's pixel and
  fails with a pointer to `--bg none`.

- **A viewBox within 1 % of square is squared.** It used to be left alone, and resvg derived
  the second side: a 100×101 mark failed with "ICO payload is 32x33", and a 101×100 mark under
  `--bg none` wrote a 512×507 `icon-512.png` that the manifest declared 512×512. The
  non-square warning still fires only above 1 %, where the stretch shows.

- **The Astro integration puts `base` into the manifest.** Under `base: '/blog'` the page
  linked `/blog/site.webmanifest`, but the icons inside it pointed at `/icon-32.png` and
  404'd, so the PWA install failed. `base` now reaches the build and the cache key.

- **A `prefers-color-scheme` block survives into `icon.svg`.** svgo inlined the class it
  selects and then dropped the `@media` rule as unused, so a dark-mode favicon lost its dark
  rules without a warning. The rasters render the light rules as before (decision 25).

- **Non-square marks produced non-square rasters.** resvg does not stretch to fill `-w N -h N`:
  it preserves the aspect ratio and derives the second dimension, so a 128×64 mark came out
  32×16 and the ICO header disagreed with its own payload. `icon.svg` now carries a square
  intrinsic size and `preserveAspectRatio="none"`; `logo.svg` keeps its real proportions.
- **`icoWrap` validates its payload's IHDR** and refuses to write a header that disagrees with
  it, which is what turned the bug above from a wrong file that passed without a word into a
  failed build.
- **An animated mark could not be built at all.** svgo 4.1.0 crashes with
  `Unmatched selector: %` on `@keyframes` nested inside another at-rule, the very shape the
  animated-input contract requires. favseed hoists nested `@keyframes` to the top level of the
  same stylesheet, where svgo's parser already skips them as it should.
- **An animated `logo.svg` lost its animation without a warning.** `inlineStyles` deletes the
  `class` attribute it consumed without checking whether a media-guarded rule still selects it,
  and csso then drops the now-unused `@media` block. `inlineStyles` is switched off for the logo
  pass, and only for a mark where some name is selected by both an inlinable rule and a
  non-inlinable one. The common shape, with the motion class named only inside the guard, keeps
  the full inlining and the same bytes it has always had.

### Removed

- The `icotool` dependency. favseed writes the 22-byte ICO container itself, byte-identical to
  `icotool -c -r` on every fixture. `icoutils` is now only a test-time nicety.
- resvg, pngquant and oxipng as install requirements, with the `pngquant-bin` optional
  dependency, the `FAVSEED_RESVG`, `FAVSEED_PNGQUANT` and `FAVSEED_OXIPNG` overrides, and the
  `toolPath()` and `toolVersions()` exports. The native pipeline survives in `bench/` as the
  measured reference.
